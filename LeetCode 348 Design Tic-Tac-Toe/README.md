## Question: https://leetcode.cn/problems/design-tic-tac-toe/

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
